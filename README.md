# Zig-Snake

## Description

A snake clone in Zig with statically-compiled SDL2

## Build

For the main project you only need a zig compiler.

However, SDL2 requires some dependencies:
- wget (downloading SDL2)
- tar (extracting SDL2)
- cmake (configuring SDL2)
- make (building SDL2)
- gcc (should have this if zig is installed tbf)

With those installed, you just need to run `make`
